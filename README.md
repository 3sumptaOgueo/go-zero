If you want to use Pasco Data Studio with its full features, you need to purchase a license key from PASCO Scientific, the developer of the software. A license key is a unique code that activates the software and allows you to use it on one computer. You can buy a license key online from the PASCO website or from an authorized reseller. The price of a license key depends on the type of license you choose: single user, site, or network.
     
However, if you are not ready to buy a license key yet, you can still try Pasco Data Studio for free with some limitations. PASCO offers a free version of the software called DataStudio Lite, which gives you access to the full features for 90 days after installation. After 90 days, DataStudio Lite will continue to work with a reduced feature set. For example, you will not be able to save or print your work, or use some advanced analysis tools. You can download DataStudio Lite from the PASCO website or from the link below. To install DataStudio Lite, you need to enter a “DataStudio Lite” key when prompted by the License Manager. You can find this key in the installation guide or in the image below.

DataStudio Lite is a great way to explore the capabilities of Pasco Data Studio and see if it meets your needs. However, if you want to use the software for longer than 90 days or with its full features, you will need to buy a Pasco Data Studio key full version. You can do so by visiting the PASCO website or contacting PASCO customer service. PASCO also offers discounts for educators and students, as well as technical support and training for using the software.

Pasco Data Studio is a powerful and versatile software that can enhance your science learning and teaching. Whether you use it for free or buy a license key, you will be able to conduct exciting experiments and investigations with various sensors and interfaces. Pasco Data Studio is compatible with Windows and Mac computers, and it works with many PASCO products such as ScienceWorkshop, SPARK Science Learning System, GLX Explorer, and more.
